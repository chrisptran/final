                    The map consists of the red team on the top half of the map and the blue team on the bottom half. Each team will consist of 5 players with a top laner that will fight on the top lane. The jungler will roam across the map and take out the camps in the interior of the map. 
                    The mid lane will of course be along the middle path. Lastly, the bottom lane will be the Attack Damage Carry (ADC) and the Support who will mainly fight side by side with the ADC.

                    The objective of the gain is to break the enemies nexus located in their base. There are turrets located on the top, mid, and bot lanes with 3 turrets each that you would have to break in order to reach the nexus. There are dragon buffs that increase increases your strength for each one you take or four of them will give a really strong buff to increase your chances of winning. There is also the baron buff that will strengthen your minions which spawns every 30 seconds.
